"Create a Python-based interactive coding competition app called CodeArena with the following features:

1. GUI Theme and Layout:

Background: black with animated moving stars.

Title: CodeArena centered at the top with a visually appealing theme.

Fields: arranged below the title with purple, pink, and blue colors; labels in white above each field.

Left side: Player's code screen; right side: AI code screen, both colorful and parallel.

Start button: visually appealing, positioned under the fields.

Cute robot mascot: same size as CodeArena text, moves to each field and guides the player with voice instructions.

2. User Interaction Flow (Robot & Voice-Guided):

Robot appears at the field currently active and narrates what to do.

Fields to fill:

Player name.

Player field (dropdown: medical, engineering, etc.).

Language (dropdown: all programming languages supported).

Language proficiency (dropdown: beginner, medium, advanced).

Game level (dropdown: easy, medium, hard).

Number of rounds and questions.

Topics to compete in (output, print, plus, minus, etc.).

Robot only moves to the next field once the current field is completed.

Voice instructions guide the player for each step.

3. Game Execution:

After fields are complete, player presses Start.

Robot moves to the center of both screens.

Timer shows countdown for each round (e.g., 5 minutes per round).

CodeArena generates coding challenges specific to the player’s field (medical, engineering, etc.).

Both player and AI submit solutions; AI tracks progress and announces who is ahead.

Robot narrates status updates: time left, player progress, AI progress.

4. End of Game:

Popup notification announces winner.

If player wins: robot shows happiness animation, flowers sparkle.

If player loses: robot shows sadness, but offers to review mistakes interactively using story/pictures and voice.

Voice narration continues throughout.

5. Technology Requirements:

Use Python with any libraries or frameworks: PyQt5, Tkinter, Pygame, Streamlit, Gradio, or others.

Integrate a Generative AI model (e.g., OpenAI API) to evaluate code, generate feedback, and simulate AI player.

Fully functional voice output and guidance using pyttsx3 or TTS library.

Animated robot that moves to fields in sync with voice instructions.

Colorful, interactive, and attractive GUI with real-time updates.

6. Special Requirements:

Fully automated voice instructions.

Dynamic content based on player’s field and preferences.

No steps skipped; robot and voice follow every field and round.

Code must be modular, maintainable, and ready to run in Python.

Deliver a working Python app that matches this description exactly, fully interactive, voice-guided, and AI-powered."
